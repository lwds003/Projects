    <h3>In The Solar System</h3>
    </div>

 <div class="para1">
   <p>  For almost as long as human beings have understood that the points of light circling</br>
     the dome of the sky were other worlds and suns, we have speculated about life</br>
     existing beyond the bounds of earth. When our understanding of the cosmos was</br>
     tentative and fearful, such speculation was considered bizarre, even heretical:</br>
     Giordano Bruno, one of the first to make a formal claim of a “plurality of worlds”,</br>
     was burnt at the stake in 1600.</p>
 </div>


<div class="para2">
   <p>Until the 1950s, these conjectures were almost entirely fanciful: tales of moon</br>
    maidens, yarns in pulp science fiction, Percival Lowell mapping nonexistentMartian</br>
    canals. As we began to realize just how inhospitable conditions were outside the</br>
    warm oasis of our planet – Venus a sulphuric hellhole, Mars a baked desert – we</br>
       began to look further afield, into interstellar space.</br></p>
</div>

<div class="para3">
    <p>Much of this period has been focused on the possibility of life beyond our own solar</br>
    system: with some 300 billion stars in the Milky Way alone, and programs like</br>
    HARPS and Kepler detecting planets around them with increasing frequency, it</br>
    would seem that no matter how rare and fortuitous the circumstances of our own</br>
    evolution might be, the odds that we are the only sentient species in the universe are</br>
    vanishingly small. But despite serious attempts to find traces of communication –</br>
    the electromagnetic "leakage" or directed communications of other civilizations</br>
    across the vast gulf of space – almost half a century of investigations have so far not</br>
        yielded any firm data.</p>

   <P>
       Beginning around the 1980’s, astro-biologists brought their eyes considerably closer</br>
       to home, seriously reconsidering the presence of life outside the bounds of Earth</br>
       but within our own solar system. Part of this change was due to revelatory</br>
       explorations of our own planet, and the recognition that our previous definitions of</br>
       the conditions necessary for life, within accepted ranges of heat, oxygenation,</br>
       and chemical balance, were wildly contradicted by the discovery of new species. Such "extremophiles"– thriving</br>
       at crushing pressures, boiling and freezing temperatures, and far away from sunlight – made biologists</br>
       reconsider the possibility of at least microbial or bacterial life on other planets in the solar system, even</br>
       moons. At this point in time, the prime contenders as habitats for life are:</br>
   </P>

</div>

<div class="para5-6">
    <h2>Mars</h2>

    <p>The source of so much alien life in science fiction, from HG Wells and Edgar Rice Burroughs to Robert</br>
    Silver berg, Mars could never be home to sentient beings in fact, although it certainly had the conditions to</br>
        support multi-cellular support in the distant past.</br></p>

   <p>Tantalizing hints of what appear to be fossils have been claimed by some scientists in the digging</br>
    explorations of the Opportunity rover and in samples of Martian meteorites that have fallen to Earth,</br>
    preserved in Arctic ice. The claim that these tiny features are organic in origin must be viewed with a great</br>
    deal of skepticism: geological processes can create very complex shapes, which human beings, with our </br>
    predisposition for pareidolia, are wont to see as significant.</br> </p>

    <p>
        Perhaps the most promising signifier of existing primitive life on Mars is the presence of seasonal methane</br>
        “blooms” in the planet’s atmosphere. While it is possible for the methane to have a geological origin:</br>
        clathrates sublimating deep underground, or the interaction of volcanic rock rich in olivine with water , the</br>
        magnitude of the release – 60 parts per billion, lasting for a year in the atmosphere – imply a major</br>
        production of the gas, far more than can readily be explained by known geological processes. Sadly, these</br>
        findings have not yet been confirmed on the ground – the Curiosity rover has so far failed to find anywhere </br>
        near that level of methane, at least in its current locale of Gale Crater.</br>

    </p>
</div>


<div class="para7-8">
    <h2> Enceladus & Europa</h2>

    <p>The moons of Saturn and Jupiter, more than a billion miles from Earth, would </br>
    appear to be the least likely home for extraterrestrial life, but Enceladus and Europa</br>
    are in unique positions: due to their close proximity to their mother planets, the</br>
    moons are constantly squeezed by gravitational resonance, producing a</br>
    phenomenon known as tidal heating. It is this constant push and pull, or ongoing</br>
    radioactive processes in the core of the moons, or a combination of the two, that</br>
    produces enough heat to produce liquid water, seen in salt-rich jets from the </br>
        southern poles of the moons.</br></p>

    <p>Frustratingly, Cassini’s mass spectrometer cannot sense the heavy, complex organic </br>
    compounds that would be a strong sign of life ejected by the cryovolcanoes on</br>
    Enceladus; neither do we have ground-penetrating radar to see the water we are certain exists underneath</br>
    the icy crusts of the moons. While more data will be gathered from Enceladus by the probe during its next </br>
    close flyby in 2015, final summary evidence will have to wait for a specialized mission, which is not yet</br>
    planned.</br></p>

    <p>Ice water geysers emerge from</br>
        the tiger stripes on the south</br>
        pole of Enceladus.</br></p>
</div>

<div class="para9-10">
    <h2>Titan</h2>

    <p>Third on our list is another moon of Saturn. Titan is far larger than Enceladus and our own moon, and would</br>
    be a planet under any other circumstance. It is the only natural satellite known to have an atmosphere (of </br>
    nitrogen) and stable bodies of liquid on its surface (comprised of methane or ethane), with what is thought to</br>
    be a liquid water layer below. Methane “smog” makes the atmosphere visually impenetrable, but also creates a</br>
        greenhouse effect that “warms” the surface (to -179° C).</p></br>

    <p>Any life on Titan that existed near the surface would have evolved based on a methane substrate, rather than </br>
    water. Before the Cassini probe reached Titan, astrobiologist Chris McKay suggested that any such life would </br>
    likely consume both atmospheric hydrogen and surface acetylene, resulting in unbalanced proportions of </br>
    these chemicals; when the probe arrived, this is exactly what was found.  By itself, this does not indicate the</br>
    presence of life: the odd mixture could also be the result of some hither-to unknown geological or</br>
        meteorological process.</p></br>



</div>



<div class="para11-12">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>Outside our own solar system, it seems increasingly likely that we will detect life through similar methods: not</br>
    by detecting alien signals or cities, but by analyzing the spectra of the exoplanet’s atmosphere as it passes in </br>
    front of its star. In a note of supreme irony, the process that concerns us most in our own environment – the</br>
    high concentration of CO2, methane, and other industrial chemicals in our atmosphere – could well be the</br>
        fingerprint of intelligent life on planets around other stars.</p></br>
